# Basic Proof Techniques
Here are the notes I have made as an extracurricular introduction to basic proof techniques and mathematical thinking for supplementing
the FADS comp.sci course at Ã…rhus University. <br />
The following notes created by the Georg-Mohr competition are also recommended reading. The induction note contains 11 more exercises with solutions.
As always do not read the solution to an exercise before working concentrated on it for a good amount of time. Only reading solutions wihthout
trying yourself is almost useless.<br />
